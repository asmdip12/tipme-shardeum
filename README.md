# TipMe â€“ Web3 Tipping Links for Everyone

## Overview
TipMe is a Web3 tipping system built for simplicity. It allows any user to receive SHM token tips via a unique link. No coding or contract deployment required.

## Problem
Crypto tipping is too technical for most users. There's no user-friendly platform for creators, freelancers, or local sellers to accept SHM tips easily.

## Solution
TipMe gives users a link (e.g., `tipme.io/yourname`) or QR code connected to their wallet address. Others can send tips using Shardeum testnet and MetaMask.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- HTML/CSS + JavaScript
- MetaMask integration
- Shardeum Sphinx Testnet
- Netlify (for hosting)
- Solidity contract (future)

## Future Features
- QR Code generation
- Plugin for YouTube/Instagram
- Optional tip history and comments
